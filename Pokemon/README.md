# Pokemon âš¡

A very simplified version of the original Pokemon game.

The player can walk around on the grass tile patch to spawn them into a battle with another pokemon.

The player can then choose to fight, or run away from the battle. Remember, be strategic, if you win, you gain experience and move onto the next level!
