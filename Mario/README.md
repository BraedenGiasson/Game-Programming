# Mario 🏃‍♂️

Based off the classic Mario game, but with a twist! 

Instead of Mario, it's a Super Alien Bro. The Super Alien Bro's goal is to kill all the snails in the level and get to the flagpole at the end of the map. If the Super Alien Bro gets hit by a snail or falls off the map, they die...

The Super Alien Bro can also hit the blocks to gain coins, or hopefully spawn a power up that makes the Super Alien Bro invisible for a short period of time!
