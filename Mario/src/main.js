 * Super Mario Bros. was instrumental in the resurgence of video
 * games in the mid-80s, following the infamous crash shortly after the
 * Atari age of the late 70s. The goal is to navigate various levels from
 * a side perspective, where jumping onto enemies inflicts damage and
 * jumping up into blocks typically breaks them or reveals a power-up.
